- Accent color: Soft green (#8BC34A), used to indicate the active or 'available' status of DSCs.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines, 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text, gives a professional, readable aesthetic.
- Uses clear and intuitive icons, like file or key symbols, to represent DSCs and their statuses (e.g., 'in storage,' 'with employee').
- Implements a four-quadrant layout, allocating specific functions to each quadrant for a clear and structured user experience.
- Subtle animations, like highlighting or smooth transitions, provide visual feedback when interacting with the DSCs.
